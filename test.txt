The problem with not closing the file when you are done with it doesn't
 have anything to do with CPU time. It is a matter of memory used for io buffers, file handles used 
(there may be an OS limitation on the number of files open at once), 
and issues with other programs wanting to use the file at the same time
The file in the example above actually gets closed - the with open(....) 
as ins: is a context processor - this means that Python takes care of freeing the resources, 
according to the "context manager" protocol, which file object adheres to.
